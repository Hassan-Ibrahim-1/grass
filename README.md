## About
A demo showcasing instancing in my engine. Renders each frame in about 10ms with 1 million blades of grass in the scene.

## Build instructions
cd into dependencies/assimp and build that first following the build instructions provided.

Go back into the project directory and run make to compile. Should just work on M-series Macs
