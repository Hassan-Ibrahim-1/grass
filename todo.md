# TODO
better performance
50 fps at only 1000 grass blades
better looking movement.
Better normals
More vertices
Better way of updating grass vertices
currently deletes recreates buffers for each blade

have a uniform of offsets for the top vertex
could apply that to the top vertex by checking if the y is 1
model matrix could just be a uniform array or an instance array
